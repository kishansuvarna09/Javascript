# Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occuring problems in software design that help developers write more maintainable and organized code.

## Commonly used design patterns

> Factory Pattern

- A factory pattern returns an object from a function, often taking parameters to determine what type of object to return

> Singleton Pattern

- A singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance, while providing a global point of access to that instance
